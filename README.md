# Company-Profit-Prediction

## Overview
 This project aims to predict the profit of companies based on their R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend using various regression algorithms. The goal is to build and evaluate different regression models to find the best-performing one for profit prediction.

## Features
* Predict company profit based on R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend.
* Compare performance across different regression algorithms.
* Evaluate models using common regression metrics.

## Project Structure
* 50_Startups.csv: Dataset file containing R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Spend, and Profit for 50 companies.
Company_Profit_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project code for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Set-up Instructions
* Open the Jupyter notebook.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook to open the project notebook.
* Follow the notebook instructions:
   The notebook Company_Profit_Prediction.ipynb contains all the code and explanations for the project.
   Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, explore data insights, preprocess data, build regression models, and evaluate their performance.
* Explore and modify:
   Feel free to modify the code, add comments, or experiment with different regression algorithms.
   The notebook is interactive, allowing you to visualize results and understand each step of the analysis.
   
## Dataset
* The dataset (50_Startups.csv) includes R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Spend, and Profit for 50 companies.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
* scikit-learn for machine learning models
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## Acknowledgments
* This project was inspired by the need to predict company profits based on various expenditures.
